2. The data is row wise consistent, but columnwise broken up into seven blocks (A -> G). Hence the naming in the datamap. So; AS1001, BS1001, CS1001, DS1001, ES1001, FS1001 and GS1001 are one and the same column with an offset. Like this:

A.....
.B....
..C...
...D..
....F.
.....G

3. Note that party affiliation is measured with three questions (see datamap file). If respondent is unsure (value 11-13) he/she gets follow up questions. For example, AS1001, AS1002 and AS1003 should be added up to party affiliation for block A. So... AS1001 to GS1003 should leave You with one data column holding party affiliation.

4. BirthYear, Gender, Municipality, SweEducation and Vote2014. Can be used for cross tabulating and/or post stratification. Or any predicitve procedure.
