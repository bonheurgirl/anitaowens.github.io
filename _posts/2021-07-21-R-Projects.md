## Introduction


End-to-end marketing and business analysis projects utilizing machine learning and statistical analysis techniques using the R programming language.


## PROJECT 1: MARKETING CAMPAIGN OPTIMIZATION - Can we identify the right customers to target?

The goal of the first project is to improve campaign marketing response rate for the bank. Marketing department needs to understand what is important. How can we allocate resources to those customers who are more likely to respond. This is a classic binary classification problem. We have customers who converted or did not convert. 

With this project, I predict marketing response rates through logistic regression and decision trees. With the output of this model, marketing gets a profile of customers who are similar to those who successfully converted from past marketing campaigns.



## PROJECT 2: MARKETING CAMPAIGN OPTIMIZATION - What do customers want?

We have a dataset of subscribers who subscribed to a magazine or not. Can we predict which customers are more likely to subscribe? The goal is to determine which customers are most likely to respond positively to our offer. This is a simple dataset with few variables and is a good dataset to practice regression modeling. By using machine learning to identify quality customer characteristics, we can save costs and improve customer acquisition with increased ROI.


## PROJECT 3: A/B TEST ANALYSIS - Was our promotion experiment successful?

The goal of project three is to analyze the results of an experiment. A chain of department stores that ran 3 promotions in different markets. The marketing team wants to know which promotion was the most effective in generating sales. The deliverable is to inform the marketing team on the results of the impact of the experiment.


## PROJECT 4: PREDICT ONLINE SHOPPING BEHAVIOR - Who is most likely to convert?

The goal is to identify what characteristics makes a converting customer? What online shopping behaviors exist so we can improve marketing (targeting and customer acquisition) and product (how can we improve our offerings or the customer experience?)


## PROJECT 5: FACEBOOK PERFORMANCE - How do we engage with potential customers on Facebook?

The project task is to analyze posts published to the Facebook page of a renowned cosmetics brand. The goal is to identify which posts led to the most customer engagement. Here, I use multiple cluster algorithms (k-means,
hierarchical and m-clust) to gather insights into post performance. Creating different tactics for different customer segments usually improves overall marketing ROI.


## PROJECT 6: CUSTOMER CHURN - Why do customers churn and what can we do about it?

Churn definition: A measure of when a customer stops being a customer.

It costs more money to acquire new customers than it is to keep the customers you already have. Successful companies know this and do what is needed to make sure new customer acquisition exceeds churn. A robust retention program is what it takes.

My personal favorite project and a common business task is to identify what factors lead customers to churn and how can we use this knowledge to improve customer retention. 

With this project, I predict customer churn rates and identify major churn factors through logistic regression and random forest modeling. With the output of these models, I was able to identify core insights for business stakeholders.


## PROJECT 7: Customer Lifetime Value - Can we predict customer sales?

Here I use two types of linear regression models on an online retail dataset to predict CLV.
